# ProjectStarter
 Creating new folders takes FOREVER (10 seconds).
 Now, its just 1 command away. New language templates will be added as I see fit.
 Add bin folder to PATH variables to allow in command line to create anywhere with ease.
 Use "proj" with args to call and use. Exe name can be changed in makefile.

## Update 2.0
 Allows for much easier templating. To add a new template, add a new folder to the templates folder.
 Next, add any subfolders/subfiles you want to be copied into the new directory. Finally, call
 with "proj -l {language/foldername}" and the system will be copied into the current working directory.
